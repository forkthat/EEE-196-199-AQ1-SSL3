%Your abstract goes here...
The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has induced the increase of time spent indoors by the general population.  The disease is transmitted through the inhalation of droplets and small particles in the air containing the virus.  With regards to this, poor indoor air quality has been discovered to influence higher infection rates of the disease in humans.  Indoor air quality monitoring (IAQM) systems employing Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology have emerged to aid in the detection of indoor air pollution (IAP).  However, most of these existing systems do not account for COVID-19 parameters and have issues regarding data transmission and power management.  This project consists of a real-time IoT-based IAQM system capable of monitoring air quality parameters related to COVID-19.  The sensors used are the Nova PM sensor SDS011, MQ135, and DHT22 which will be integrated to ESP32, a microcontroller unit, to create a sensor node.  The sensor nodes of the system measure specific air quality parameters which are PM2.5, PM10, carbon monoxide (CO), temperature, and relative humidity.  The sensor nodes are connected to a gateway by using the star or partial mesh topology for comparison.  Then, the data acquired by the gateway is sent to a Blynk database server for data visualization, monitoring, and analysis.  Throughput, latency, packet loss, power consumption, and mean time between failure (MTBF) were measured to evaluate the IAQM system.  For further testing, the number of sensor nodes were varied to analyze its impact on the performance of the system.  The outcome of this project could benefit the educational community as there is already an ongoing transition from online classes to face-to-face setup while still in the COVID-19 pandemic.

\chapter{Introduction\label{cha:Introduction}}

\section{COVID-19 and its Relevance to Air Quality}
\label{section:sec01_01}

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus which severely affects the human respiratory system, triggered a disruption in most of the world?s economy for tourism and retail and forced the implementation of stringent containment measures \cite{RePEc:imf:imfwpa:2021/018}. The COVID-19 disease gets transmitted when people breathe air contaminated by droplets and small airborne particles containing the virus. The risk of breathing the disease is highest when people are in close proximity.  It is then crucial to maintain a considerable distance from others and for people to stay most of the time inside their homes. Unfortunately, they can also be inhaled over longer distances, even when indoors \cite{doi:10.1126/science.abd9149} \cite{https://doi.org/10.1111/ina.12751}.

\chapter{Related Work\label{cha:RRW}}

This chapter details the different works \textbf{related} to your topic. The rule of thumb in writing this section is to start from a broad range of topics and narrowing it down to your topic of interest.

Note that this is a \emph{review} so you need to identify the \emph{problems} of the work you are reviewing. Critically criticize their work, identify what is common between them and differentiate your proposed solution from them. This is the most difficult part of your proposal.

\chapter{Problem Statement and Objectives \label{cha:ProbStatement}}

\section{Problem Statement}

The problem is stated here in one coherent paragraph summarizing your RRW.

\section{Objectives of the Project}
\label{section:sec_obj}
The \textbf{concrete} goals of the project are stated here. Define the metrics that will measure the success of your project. It will be the basis for your examiner for your 198 grade.

\section{Scopes and Limitations}
\label{scopes}
This optional section defines the scope of the project. The project must be doable in 16 weeks and this section ensures that limit to be possible for you. The stated goals from section \ref{section:sec_obj} may not be achievable within 16 weeks if you don't define the scope.

\chapter{Methodology\label{cha:Methodology}}

This chapter outlines the different design and testing techniques you will perform to measure the success of your project. For the designs, detail everything up to the calculations and derivations. Cite your references if possible. Include relevant block diagrams and/or graphs. For the experiments, detail everything down to the number of trials, parameters you will measure, and the number of data points you will measure.

\section{Displaying an Image using includegraphics}

\begin{figure} [H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/S11_hpf.png}
    \caption{This figure is a graph}
    \label{fig:S11_graph}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:S11_graph} is an example of an image that is inserted using \texttt{includegraphics\{\}} command. The command can use a JPEG, PNG, and GIF file extensions to place an image. The \texttt{figure} float object needs the \texttt{H} in the command seen above to determine how it will be placed. Table \ref{tab:float_placement_identifier} summarizes the different float object placement commands.

\begin{table}[!t]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Command} & \textbf{Effect} \\\hline
        h & Place the float \emph{here}, i.e., \emph{approximately}\\
         & at the same point (however, not \emph{exactly} at the spot) \\\hline
        t & Place the float at the \emph{top} of the page \\\hline
        b & Place the float at the \emph{bottom} of the page \\\hline
        p & Put on a special \emph{page} for floats \\\hline
        ! & Override internal parameters LaTeX uses for\\
         & determining "good" float positions \\\hline
        H & Places the float at precisely the location in the LaTeX code.\\
         & Requires the \texttt{float} package, i.e., \texttt{usepackage{float}} \\\hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Floating object placement identifier}
    \label{tab:float_placement_identifier}
\end{table}

\section{Generating an Image using circuitikz}

\begin{figure} [H]
    \centering
    \begin{circuitikz} [american voltages, american currents, scale=0.8]
        \draw [thick]
            (0,0) node[op amp] (opamp) {}
            (-1.5,0.625) -- (-2.5,0.625) -- (-2.5,2) to[R,l=$1\,M\Omega$] (2,2) -- (2,0) -- (1.5,0)
            (-2.5,2) to [R,*-,l_=$100\,k\Omega$] (-5.5,2) node[ground]{}
            (-1.5,-0.625) to[short,-o] (-2.5,-0.625) node[label={left:$v_i$}]{}
            (2,0) to[short,*-o] (3,0) node[label={right:$v_o$}]{}
            
        ;
    \end{circuitikz}
    \caption{This is an operational amplifier circuit}
    \label{fig:op_amp}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:op_amp} is an example of an image generated through the TikZ package of LaTeX. Specifically, it uses the CircuiTikZ package which is specialized for circuit diagrams. It is by no means limited to circuits as block diagrams can also be generated using the said package \cite{circuitikz_howto,tikz_howto}. Just consult the circuitikz and tikz manuals on how to use the package.

\section{Generating a Table}

The code below is used to make table \ref{tab:AM_comparison}. The \texttt{tabular} command is used to generate the table. The command \texttt{hline} generates the \emph{horizontal lines} between rows. The lines between columns are generated automatically.

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Modulation Type} & Description \\\hline
        Full AM & Loren ipsum dolor... \\\hline
        DSB-SC & Loren ipsum dolor... \\\hline
        SSB & Loren ipsum dolor... \\\hline
        VSB & Loren ipsum dolor... \\\hline
        VSB+C & Loren ipsum dolor... \\\hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Summary of Amplitude Modulation Schemes}
    \label{tab:AM_comparison}
\end{table}{}

\section{Making a Citation}

The \texttt{cite} command is used to make citations that are taken from \texttt{bibfile.bib} seen in the files of the LaTeX manuscript. An online manual can be used to check the supported formats of the IEEE format bibliography \cite{bibtex_howto}. If a citation is taken from the IEEEXplore Digital Library, the BibTeX format can be easily downloaded as shown in figures \ref{fig:IEEEXplore_citation} and \ref{fig:IEEEXplore_BibTeX}. The citation will automatically appear in the bibliography section of the document \cite{quitevis_ambatali}.

\begin{figure} [H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/download_citations.png}
    \caption{IEEEXplore Article Page}
    \label{fig:IEEEXplore_citation}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure} [H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figures/download_bibtex.png}
    \caption{IEEEXplore Download BibTeX}
    \label{fig:IEEEXplore_BibTeX}
\end{figure}
